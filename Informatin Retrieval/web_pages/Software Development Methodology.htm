<p><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><u>Methodologies</u>: What and Why?</font></strong></p>

<p><font size="3">Software engineering is the practice of using selected process
techniques to improve the quality of a software development effort.&nbsp; This is based on
the assumption, subject to endless debate and supported by patient experience, that a
methodical approach to software development results in fewer defects and, therefore,
ultimately provides shorter delivery times and better value.&nbsp; The documented
collection of policies, processes and procedures used by a development team or
organization to practice software engineering is called its software development
methodology (SDM) or system development life cycle (SDLC).</font></p>

<p><strong><u><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Methodology as Risk Management</font></u></strong></p>

<p><font size="3">The challenge in selecting and following a methodology is to do it
wisely -- to provide sufficient process disciplines to deliver the quality required for
business success, while avoiding steps that waste time, squander productivity, demoralize
developers, and create useless administrivia.&nbsp; The best approach for applying a
methodology is to consider it as a means to <a href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_risk.htm">manage risk</a>.&nbsp;
You can identify risks by looking at past projects.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If your organization has been plagued by problems resulting from poor
requirements management, then a robust requirements management methodology would be well
advised.&nbsp; Once this problem has been solved, through a repeatable process, the
organization might then streamline its process, while ensuring that quality is maintained.
&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Every step along the system development life cycle has its own risks and
a number of available techniques to improve process discipline and resulting output
quality.&nbsp; Moving through the development life cycle, you might encounter the
following major steps:</font> 

</p><ul>
  <li><font size="3">Project charter and business case</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Definition of the business process and business requirements</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Documentation of user, functional and system requirements</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Top level architecture, technical approach, and system design</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">System decomposition into component and unit specifications and design</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Coding, unit test planning, and unit test</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Generation of test data for unit testing and system testing</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">System integration and testing</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Implementation, delivery and cut-over</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Training and user support</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">System upgrades and routine software maintenance</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">In addition, you might have support activities throughout the
development effort such as:</font> 

</p><ul>
  <li><font size="3"><a href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_cm.htm">Configuration management</a> (version identification,
    baseline management and change control)</font></li>
  <li><font size="3"><a href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_reqs.htm">Requirements</a> management and tracability </font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Quality management (quality assurance, quality reviews, defect tracking)</font></li>
  <li><font size="3"><a href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_desreviews.htm">System engineering reviews</a> (requirements
    review, prelim. and critical design reviews, etc.)</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Support environment (development tools, libraries, files management, data
    management)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">Written guidance for all these steps would constitute the core of your
methodology.&nbsp; You can see how it wouldn't take long to fill a number of big binders
with development processes and procedures.&nbsp; Hence, the importance of selecting
processes wisely - to address known risks - keeping the methodology streamlined, and
allowing for some discretion on the part of the project team.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><strong><u><font color="#FF0000" size="3">Waterfall Methodology</font></u></strong></p>

<p><font size="3">All projects can be managed better when segmented into a hierarchy of
chunks such as <a href="http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_fazes.htm">phases</a>, stages, activities, tasks and
steps.&nbsp; In system development projects, the simplist rendition of this is called the
"waterfall" methodology, as shown in the following figure:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="./Software Development Methodology_files/pm_sdm5.gif" width="480" height="264"></p>

<p align="left">In looking at this graphic, which was for major defense systems
developments, please note this presumes that the system requirement have already been
defined and scrubbed exhaustively, which is probably the most important step towards
project success.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the graphic illustrates a few critical principles of
a good methodology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work is done in stages, </li>
  <li><font size="3">Content reviews are conducted between stages, and</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Reviews represent quality gates and decision points for continuing.</font></li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The waterfall provides an orderly sequence of development
steps and helps ensure the adequacy of documentation and design reviews to ensure the
quality, reliability, and maintainability of the developed software.&nbsp; </font>While
almost everyone these days disparages the "waterfall methodology" as being
needlessly slow and cumbersome, it does illustrate a few sound principles of life cycle
development.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><b><u>Spiral Methodology</u>:</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">While the waterfall methodology offers an orderly structure for software
development, demands for reduced time-to-market make its series steps inappropriate. </font>The
next evolutionary step from the waterfall is where the various steps are staged for
multiple deliveries or handoffs.&nbsp; The ultimate evolution from the water fall is the
spiral, taking advantage of the fact that development projects work best when they are
both incremental and iterative, where the team is able to start small and benefit from
enlightened trial and error along the way.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="3">The spiral methodology reflects the relationship of tasks with rapid
prototyping, increased parallelism, and concurrency in design and build activities. The
spiral method should still be planned methodically, with tasks and deliverables identified
for each step in the spiral.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The reality is that increased processes usually result in increased
documentation.&nbsp; An improved process produces intermediate work products that
represent the elaboration of the product design at each step in the development life
cycle.&nbsp; Where possible, documentation should be generated using automated tools, so
outputs can contribute to generation of code structures or help generate the code
itself.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The difference between hacking and software engineering is professional
discipline applied with common sense. Software quality, reliability, and maintainability
are enhanced by having good documentation for requirements, architecture, interfaces,
detailed design, well-commented code, and good test procedures.&nbsp; Requirements
documentation practices should facilitate your customer's understanding and review of the
real requirements.&nbsp; Software project planning should include estimating the time and
resources to produce, review, approve, and manage such documentation products.</font></p>

Integration (CMMI) </font></u></p>

<p><font size="3">Some years ago the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon
Institute in Pittsburgh established standards and guidance for developing software
engineering disciplines and management.&nbsp; This was known as the Capability Maturity
Model (CMM), and its use has become widespread among mature software development
organizations, especially for those developing large scale software in a competitive
procurement environment. Government and corporate software customers have increasingly
required that proposals include information about a software development organization's
certified level of maturity.&nbsp; The CMM had recognized five steps towards
organizational software maturity:</font> 

</p><ul>
  <li><font size="2"><strong>Level 1 (Initial) </strong>- Processes are <em>ad hoc</em> and
    occasionally chaotic. Few processes are defined, and success depends on individual effort
    and heroics. <em>(A street-person with a laptop would be at Level 1.)</em></font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><strong>Level 2 (Repeatable)</strong> - Basic project management
    processes are established to track cost, schedule and functionality. A process discipline
    is in place to repeat earlier successes on projects with similar applications.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><strong>Level 3 (Defined)</strong> - Management and engineering processes
    are documented and integrated into a standard software process. Projects use an approved,
    tailored version of the organization’s standard software process.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><strong>Level 4 (Managed)</strong> - Detailed measures of the software
    process and product quality are collected. Processes and products are quantitatively
    understood and controlled.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2"><strong>Level 5 (Optimizing)</strong> - Continuous process improvement is
    aided by quantitative feedback from the process and from piloting innovative ideas and
    technologies.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">Around year 2000, the SEI introduced the next major evolution along this
path - called</font>Capability Maturity Model<sup>Â®</sup> Integration (CMMI).&nbsp; This
builds on the previous CMM, which is now regarded as "legacy" and no longer
supported.&nbsp; You can find introductions to the CMMI and sample models at this Web
